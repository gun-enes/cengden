PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES AND FRAMEWORKS
I prefered Node.js for creating the website, since i am already familiar. Some useful features of Node.js such as seeing every change in the website as soon as i save the file are also among the reasons I've chosen it. I  used a template for front-end  and just make some slight changes in that by using html and css.
I chose Express.js since it provides some features for web development such as middleware and routing. It is also easy to connect and interact with MongoDb.
